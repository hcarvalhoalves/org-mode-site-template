* Emacs Org Mode Site Template

This is a template project to kickstart publishing a complete site using the Emacs Org-Mode HTML export publishing options.

** How the code is structured

- Makefile :: Useful aliases for publishing and testing the site locally.
- publish.el :: Script to configure the HTML export options of ox-publish.
- src/ :: All your site sources live here.
- src/static/ :: Static files, like main CSS and other multimedia files can live here. Media related to individual pages can live anywhere.
- public/ :: The published site is exported here. This should be your document root on the HTTP server.

** How the publishing works

In the publish.el we configure a project with three components:

- A `static` component that will copy all new or modified media files (defined on `static-extensions`) to `public/`.
- A `pages` component that will publish all .org files as .html to `public/`, including default headers and footer. This will also generate a sitemap.org file with a list of all other .org files found recursivly under `src/`.
- A `index` component that publishes the index.orgi file as index.html to `public/`. This is so we can trigger the publishing of the index at the end, after all other files have been created, such that the index can include them.

** Default template

The style defined in `src/static/t.css` is my version of the Tufte CSS [1], stripped-down to a minimal and adapted for mobile.

See an example on how to use its classes on `src/articles/foo.org`.

** Testing it

Update $EMACS in the Makefile to point to your Emacs installation and try:

$ make pub test
